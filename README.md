> *"Turning caffeine into code and transforming data into intelligence, one algorithm at a time"* ☕️→💻

## 🚀 Currently Building the Future
🎓 **MS Computer Science @ SLU** | Researching Privacy Threats in Continuous Learning  
💼 **Generative AI Engineer** | Crafting enterprise AI solutions that actually work  
🔬 **AI Ethics Advocate** | Because with great models comes great responsibility  

## 💡 What I Speak Fluently
**Human Languages:** English, Telugu, Hindi  
**AI Languages:** GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA, BERT (and their extended families)  
**Code Dialects:** Python 🐍 | JavaScript ⚡ | SQL 📊 | Java ☕  
**Cloud Conversations:** AWS ☁️ | Azure 🌐 | Docker 🐳  

## 🎯 My Superpowers
- **🧠 LLM Whispering:** Making AI models do exactly what they're supposed to (most of the time)
- **⚡ Latency Slaying:** Reduced system response times by 40% (because nobody likes to wait)  
- **🏗️ Architecture Wizardry:** Building scalable systems that handle 500+ concurrent users like a boss  
- **🔍 RAG Engineering:** Teaching AI to remember what it learned (revolutionary, I know)  
- **🚀 Production Debugging:** Turning "it doesn't work" into "it works beautifully"

## 📈 By the Numbers
```
500+ concurrent users served
40% latency reduction achieved  
25% NLP accuracy improvement
90% system uptime enhancement
2.5M+ daily transactions managed
$50K annual cost savings delivered
```

## 🎨 When I'm Not Debugging AI Models
🏆 **Former Women Entrepreneur of the Year** (2018)  
🏅 **Employee of the Month** (for making production incidents extinct)  
🎯 **Hackathon Enthusiast** (STLHack, SLUHack survivor)  
📚 **Research Paper Author** (because sharing knowledge is caring)

## 🌟 Fun AI Facts I Love
💡 The first computer "bug" was literally a moth in 1947 (Grace Hopper was ahead of her time!)  
🤖 I speak to transformers daily (and they actually listen)  
⚡ I can make APIs so fast, they break the speed of light (okay, maybe just network latency)
